            Recently, after lots of reading, I still didn't know where to start in building my own 
            musical sofware tools.
            The idea for Patch Notes came after some time thinking of solutions for managing the
            programs and patching for an array of hardware synthesizers and MIDI instruments.  
            Inspired by Nick Batt's use of Yamaha Setlist for iOS, I thought of creating a similar 
            solution to embedding patching notes into a DAW track for reference during a live session.

            Patch Notes is a Digital Audio Workstation plugin designed to afford hardware synthesizer 
            players an easier experience managing patch settings between DAW sessions.  
            More than a system for remembering and issuing Program Change messages, Patch Notes aims
            to cater to analog or other non-MIDI enabled gear, allowing the musician quick access to 
            critical information related to setting up a patch.  Patch Notes is currently in 
            design and development, and you can track the progress on
