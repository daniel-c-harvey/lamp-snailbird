    Coming from being a drummer in a groove-oriented metal scene, I have a lot to learn 
    about what made a good composition when working with pitched instruments.  The work I did under Square Peg has given 
    me the skills to take my music further down my own path.  I started producing faster and heavier techno styles in 
    late 2020 and I haven't made much music since then that I feel would fit the Square Peg pathos, but I do plan to 
    finish that material and release another Square Peg EP sometime not too far down the road.

    Check out the <a href="studio?page=square-peg-releases">Releases Highlights</a> page to hear some examples.  I have a goal to add track details for some of the more technically interesting projects.
