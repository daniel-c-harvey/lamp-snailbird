    <a href="https://reaper.fm">REAPER</a> has become the beating heart of how 
    I make and play music, and to talk about some of my current use cases and 
    workflows for playing live with synthesizers, I thought it may make more 
    sense to start at the beginning.

    I started using the software for basic multitrack recording of a metal band back in 
    2012 and then as I moved and lost access to a space to play drums, 
    I focused all my creativity into in-the-box synthwave-ish productions in REAPER. 
    Having never made or really even listened to very much electronic music, 
    my first influences were an eclectic blend of artists such as 
    <a href="https://autechre.bandcamp.com/track/further">Autechre</a>, 
    <a href="https://blankbanshee.bandcamp.com/track/b-start-up">Blank</a>

    <a href="https://gost1980s.bandcamp.com/track/amys-wager">GoST</a>,

    It took a long time working through the <a href="studio.php?page=square-peg-releases">Square Peg</a> 
    project to develop a deeper sense for electronic musical instruments, their uses, and their capabilities.  
    During this time, I spent a lot of time playing with simple free instruments, falling in love with 
    <a href="https://www.blaukraut.info/">BlauKraut's Charlatan</a>, 
    and learning how to sequence MIDI arrangements inside of REAPER.

            In 2020 I made a move to a longer term living space, and for the first time in 5
             years I didn't have to worry about moving out 3 months after I moved in.  
            I got to work setting up my Bass Station 2 and Minilogue XD from the time 
            for integration with REAPER, and began to produce songs arranged in the box, 
            recording takes on the hardware instruments.

            I began to try and use the hardware sequencers I had available, 
            although I never got the hang of the sequencer in the bass station.
            The rhythm dial was not musically intuitive to me, and the step 
            sequencing was only useful for patterns that always felt too short.  
            For a while I attempted to use the Bass Station as accompaniment for myself on drum set along with a guitar buddy
            The sequencer in the Minilogue XD allowed me to discover motion/CC/CV 
            sequencing and I quickly yearned for a master sequencer that could conduct 
            an arrangement more sophisticated than the loopy 1-bar patterns.  
            At the time my MIDI controller was a LaunchKey Mk3, after selling a 
            Panorama T-series that I couldn't properly fit on my desktop and had an 
            over 3-month-long support case to try and use the Nektar DAW integration 
            that ended up in getting ghosted.  I ended up loving the features of 
            the LaunchKey for standalone instrument control.  The arpeggiator was 
            unusually inspiring, unlike the similarly designed rhythm knob on 
            the Bass Station I got rid of.

            Three years down this path led me to focusing on hardware instruments, a more 
            hands-on and expressive way to make electronic music.  
            I spent a lot of time jamming out simple sequences on an expanding set of hardware.  
            Throughout 2023 I spent time learning my instruments and dreaming up more 
            sophisticated ways to make music on that hardware rig.  
            For the first time ever, playing my synth orchestra began to feel like an instrument.

    There were two pieces of gear that took my synth desk from a toy to a usable production environment. 
    The Novation SL MkIII, which I'll be talking a lot about, and the Roland TR-8S drum machine.  
    I'm picky with my drum sounds and while the hardware is great it was unreasonable to synthesize 
    all my drums live, I just couldn't spare the voices.  
    I had my favorite kick patch on the Minilogue, pinging the filter in resonance with a nice thumpy sweep, 
    but it felt cruel to give up a polysynth for a kick drum. 
    The TR allows me to sequence my own synthesized drum samples along side the ACB models, FM engines, etc.  
    I finally could get the drums I love intuitively going while I played.  
    I used the SL to write almost every song I committed to during the year, and began to appreciate the 
    instant ability to sequence and program new things while playing. 
    I'm no keyboard player, and tend to program all melodies and patterns save for fills and mushy ambient-type chords.

    The hardware sequencing opened up new doors, and started me thinking of new ways to use the SL.  
    The Novation Components software let's you set up any number of useful MIDI control configurations, 
    and REAPER lets you bind a great number of functions to any MIDI CC trigger, 
    so I began of thinking of ways to use the encoders and faders to control REAPER.  
    The obvious starting place was some FX controls, so I set up some filters and a sequenced amp gate that I could play from the keyboard while jamming.   
    It's great to be able to high-pass the whole rhythm section with one fader, instead of needing to twist several macro knobs as concurrently as possible.
