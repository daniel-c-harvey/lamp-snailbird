    I wanted to test what a twitch broadcast with the rig might look and sound like, and this is the result.  
    Skip to 7 minutes to get past all the patch setup, this was really a test run and not entirely focused on  
    the musical aspects as much as the technical capabilities of the setup, but I found that this test jam ended 
    sounding like an acceptable performance and here it is.
