<p>
    Square Peg is a project I started when I first moved from playing metal to writing and producing electronic music.  
    The three EPs are a progressive exploration of synthesis and sequencing possibilities as I learned how electronic 
    sounds could come alive.  A blend between synthwave and other dark styles, the music was made to be exactly what I 
    wanted to listen to while driving around the city at night.  Mostly by serendipity, though.

    Coming from being a drummer in a groove-oriented metal scene, I have a lot to learn 
    about what made a good composition when working with pitched instruments.  The work I did under Square Peg has given 
    me the skills to take my music further down my own path.  I started producing faster and heavier techno styles in 
    late 2020 and I haven't made much music since then that I feel would fit the Square Peg pathos, but I do plan to 
    finish that material and release another Square Peg EP sometime not too far down the road.
