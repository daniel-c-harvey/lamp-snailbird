    Making heavy industrial drums and bass sounds is something I've struggled with for a long time despite loving the style.  
    This was a test of some ideas for a heavier rhythm section.  The synth and drum parts are inspired by stamping plants, 
    emergency alarms, and a sense of urgency and panic.  I ended up loving the simple acid ostinato in 5/16 and the 
    polymetric modulation that occurs as a result.  I hope you enjoy too.
