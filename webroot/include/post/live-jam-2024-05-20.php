    This week I have traveled back to Michigan for Movement, and brought some instruments and a recorder with me to "make use of the juice."
    The setup is simply a drum machine and two synthesizers through a passive mixer and directly into a handheld recorder.
    Heavy use of effects pedals as well.  The whole rig runs off a couple of USB battery bricks and this is my first trip with this equipment.
    The first real recording turned out to prove that this rig is really a terrific instrument, 
    as I had a lot of fun jamming for hours before deciding to capture a take.
